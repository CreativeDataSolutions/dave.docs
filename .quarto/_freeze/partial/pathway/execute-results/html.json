Enrichment is calculated based on the `KEGG` database and reference (ko) organism.\n\n#### [Calculate]{.txbox_gray}\n\n::::: columns \n::: column \n##### Select the name of the column with `KEGG` id for each variable.

Selection of interesting pathways to investigate further could involve: 1) verifying that the pathway has a moderate minimum number of variables (e.g. > 10) 2) identifying low `p-value` and high `prct` enriched pathways 3) visualizing the network topology of enriched variables in the pathway (e.g. look for metabolic proximity of cha ges which may signify a functional module) . NOTE: Some very large and generic pathways such as `Metabolic pathways` can take a few minutes to render.\n\n::: \n\n::: column \n![](img/dave.path/enrich_results.png){.bordered}\n:::\n:::\n\n#### [Plot]{.txbox_gray}\n\n::::: columns \n::: column \n##### Select pathway name and identify the column to use as the `fold-change` to view variable changes mapped to the pathway.\n\n::: \n\n::: column \n![](img/dave.path/plot_menue.png){.bordered}\n:::\n:::\n\n::::: columns \n::: column \n##### The `fold-changes` normalized to between -1 and 1 are mapped onto pathway entities as described in the color bar in the top right corner.\n\n::: \n\n::: column \n![](img/dave.path/pathway_plot.png){.bordered}\n:::\n:::\n\n#### [Report]{.txbox_gray}\n\n::::: columns \n::: column \n##### Select the number of top pathways (based on `p-value`) to show in table outputs and which `pathways` to show visualizations of.\n\n::: \n\n::: column \n![](img/dave.path/report.png){.bordered}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",

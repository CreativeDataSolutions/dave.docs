# Multivariate
##### the [multivariate]{.txbox_green} module supports dimensional reduction and projection pursuits.

### [PCA]{.txbox_green}

##### Principal components analysis (PCA) can be used to summarise the major modes of variance in the data by fewer and uncorrelated principal components (PCs). It is helpful to analyze how sample and variable meta data is related to PCA sample scores and variable loadings.

#### [Calculate]{.txbox_gray}

::::: columns

##### The `screeplot` shows the variance explained by each PC. The dashed line marks the 1 % variance limit below which components can be ommited.

##### The `diagnostics` plot can be used to identify moderate and extreme sample outliers. Large sample `leverage` denotes a large influence of the samples variance to the identification of the PC components (outliers). The `DmodX` or highlights moderate multivariate sample differences. Samples showing both high `leverage` and `DmodX` should be investigated further.

::::: columns 
::: column 
##### The `biplot` can be used to simultaneously visualize sample scores and loadings over layed on top of each other. Variables with extreme loadings (large positive or negative x/y position) have the largest effects on the sample scores (may correspond to low or high values among samples with similairly extreme scores compared to others).

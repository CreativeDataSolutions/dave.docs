##### DAVe is comprised of individual which can be linked to create a variety of unique data analysis workflows. Global Utilities include `r dcr_g('Data')`, `r dcr_g('Plot')` and `r dcr_g('Report')` which are used to manage data, interactively create plots and reports from assets generated with the data analysis.

## [A]{.numberCircle} [Select]{.txbox_blue}

##### The navigation bar is used to select different analyses. Each analysis may also have sub-options. Typical workflows will include choosing modules from the nav bar progressing from left to right e.g. loading the data in `r dcr_g('Data')` and then formatting the data for analysis in the `r dcr_g('Preprocess')` module.

## [B]{.numberCircle} [Controls]{.txbox_blue}

##### The sidebar is used to select analyses methods, tune visualizations and specify report options.

## [C]{.numberCircle} [Workflow]{.txbox_blue}

##### The tabpanel can be used to progress through `r dcr('calculate')`, `r dcr('explore')`, `r dcr('plot')` and `r dcr('report')` analysis steps. The `r dcr('calculate')` tab is used to select method options and generate analysis results. The `r dcr('explore')` tab is used to create interactive plots to explore and summarize objects created in the `r dcr('calculate')` tab. The `r dcr('plot')` tab is used to fine-tune visualizations for the `r dcr('report')`. The `r dcr('report')` tab is used to collect all methods, results and plot settings and generate a report summarizing all of data analysis methods and results. Each module's reports can be later combined and edited in the `r dcr_g('Report')` module.

  
## [D]{.numberCircle} [Results]{.txbox_blue}

##### This is the main panel where calculation, exploration, plotting and report results will be output to. Results may include both static and interactive results which can be manipulated further.
